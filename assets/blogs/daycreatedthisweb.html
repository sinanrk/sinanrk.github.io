            The time is around 2:00 AM. I am driven by a kind of obsession I often enjoy, working on 
            something creative. Since yesterday afternoon, I could not completely disconnect from my 
            laptop. I went to sleep, but my mind was wandering through the section of this website, 
            'how can I design and arrange my publication?', 'what should I write in the contact section?' 
            Sleep had no interest in helping me today. And that's how I ended up back in front of the 
            screen in the middle of the night.

            I haven't built a website from scratch before. I had to rely on user-friendly templates. 
            My mind is searching through past pages. I remember growing up, I never felt like playing 
            with a computer. But yes, there were reasons for that. However, as time passed by, 
            I gradually realized the breadth of potential creativity one can achieve with a computer. 
            Although I have been coding for a while in Python for my research, I never took a deep 
            dive into HTML. Probably because I never felt the need for it, especially from a career 
            standpoint. But now, AI has made everything easy to catch up. Here, I feel excited and 
            happy while typing through this... This is the day I created this website.
