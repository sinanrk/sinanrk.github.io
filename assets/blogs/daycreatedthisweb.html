        <h1>Day I created this website</h1>

        <p>
            The time is around 2:00 AM. I am driven by a kind of obsession I often enjoy, working on 
            something creative. Since yesterday afternoon, I could not completely disconnect with my laptop. 
            I went to sleep, but my mind was wandering through the section of this website, 'how can I design 
            arrange my publication?', 'what should I write in the concact section?'... sleep had no interests
            in helping me today. And that's how I ended up back in front of the screen in the middle of the
            night.

            I haven't built a website from scratch before. I had to rely on user friendly templates.
            My mind is searching through past pages.  I remeber growing up, I never felt playing with 
            a computer. But yes, there were reasons for that. Howver, as time passed by, I gradually 
            realized the breadth of potential creativity one can achieve with a computer. Although I 
            have been coding for a while in python for my research, I never took a deep dive into html. 
            Probably because I never felt the need of it, especially from a career stantpoint. But now,
            AI has made everything easy to catch up. Here, I feel excited and happy while typing through this...
