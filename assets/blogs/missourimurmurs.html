            A fine Saturday evening. The weather in Omaha is getting gorgeous. Gloomy days of winter 
            are on its way out. Here I am, sitting ashore Missouri, thanking my privilege to breathe 
            this beautiful air, to hear the soothing sound of the big muddy. As I watch her, my 
            thoughts travel along her flow. She has a lots of stories to tell, like my old 
            grandmother. I tried to listen. From her headwaters up in the North, to the moment 
            she joins her beloved Mississippi, until they fall into the lap of Atlantic, she sees 
            myriad lives, joys, and struggles. Happy stories of thriving civilizations on her 
            shoulders, adventures of early explorers, sorrows of exploitations. I tried harder to 
            listen her. But the old lady is weak now, with a stumbling voice. Maybe so, no one hears 
            her. Her veins are getting dryer. "I provided everything to them, but now I am forgotten 
            to be taken care of" she murmured in her weak voice. It sounded like a mother ignored by her 
            kins. Can a hydrologist console her? I tried even harder to listen her.
